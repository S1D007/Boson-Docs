# Boson Architecture

The Boson framework is built upon a clean, modular architecture that prioritizes performance, maintainability, and flexibility. This page provides a high-level overview of how the framework is structured and how its components interact.

## Architectural Principles

Boson's architecture is guided by several key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility
2. **Modularity**: Components are decoupled and can be used independently
3. **Composability**: Components can be combined in flexible ways
4. **Performance**: Optimized data flow with minimal overhead
5. **Testability**: Components designed for easy testing in isolation
6. **Extensibility**: Clear extension points for customization

## Core Architecture Layers

Boson's architecture can be visualized as a stack of layers, each building upon the previous:

<!-- ![Boson Architecture Diagram](/img/boson-architecture.png) -->

### 1. Core Foundation Layer

The foundation layer provides essential services used throughout the framework:

- **Memory Management**: Custom allocators and memory pools
- **Event Loop**: Asynchronous execution environment
- **Threading Model**: Thread pool and work distribution
- **I/O Abstraction**: Non-blocking input/output operations
- **Error Handling**: Exception management and propagation
- **Logging**: Structured logging infrastructure

### 2. HTTP Layer

Built on the foundation layer, the HTTP layer manages the raw HTTP protocol:

- **Connection Management**: TCP socket handling
- **HTTP Parser**: Efficient parsing of HTTP messages
- **Protocol Implementation**: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support
- **TLS Integration**: Secure connection handling
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient data buffering

### 3. Server Layer

The server layer orchestrates the HTTP communication:

- **Request Lifecycle**: Coordinating request handling from receipt to response
- **Connection Pooling**: Managing persistent connections
- **Timeout Management**: Handling request timeouts
- **Worker Coordination**: Distributing work across threads

### 4. Middleware Layer

The middleware layer provides a pipeline for request processing:

- **Middleware Chain**: Sequential processing of middleware
- **Global Middleware**: Applied to all requests
- **Route Middleware**: Applied to specific routes
- **Middleware Groups**: Logical groupings of middleware

### 5. Routing Layer

The routing layer determines how requests are dispatched:

- **Route Registration**: Defining URL patterns and handlers
- **Route Matching**: Matching incoming requests to registered routes
- **Parameter Extraction**: Pulling values from URL patterns
- **Route Generation**: Creating URLs from route definitions

### 6. Controller Layer

The controller layer organizes related route handlers:

- **Controller Classes**: Grouping related actions
- **Dependency Injection**: Providing services to controllers
- **Action Methods**: Individual request handlers
- **Response Generation**: Creating appropriate responses

### 7. Application Layer

The application layer provides high-level services:

- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings
- **Service Container**: Dependency management
- **Authentication**: User identification
- **Authorization**: Access control
- **Session Management**: State across requests
- **Caching**: Response and data caching

### 8. Database Layer

The database layer manages data persistence:

- **Connection Management**: Database connectivity
- **Query Building**: SQL generation
- **Transaction Management**: ACID compliance
- **Migration System**: Schema evolution
- **Model Binding**: Data to object mapping

## Component Communication

Components in Boson communicate through well-defined interfaces:

1. **Direct Method Calls**: For synchronous, in-process communication
2. **Callbacks and Futures**: For asynchronous operations
3. **Event System**: For loosely coupled communication
4. **Dependency Injection**: For service provision

## Request Lifecycle

A typical request flows through Boson's architecture as follows:

1. Client sends HTTP request to server
2. HTTP parser processes raw request data
3. Request object is created from parsed data
4. Global middleware processes the request
5. Router matches request to a route
6. Route-specific middleware is applied
7. Controller action is executed
8. Response is generated
9. Response middleware is applied in reverse order
10. HTTP response is sent back to client

## Extensibility Points

Boson provides several mechanisms for extending functionality:

1. **Custom Middleware**: For request/response processing
2. **Service Providers**: For registering services
3. **Custom Commands**: For CLI functionality
4. **Event Listeners**: For responding to system events
5. **Custom Handlers**: For specialized request processing

## Performance Optimizations

Boson incorporates various performance optimizations:

1. **Memory Pooling**: Reducing allocation overhead
2. **Zero-copy Operations**: Minimizing data copying
3. **Lazy Loading**: Loading components only when needed
4. **Compile-time Evaluation**: Using templates for static dispatch
5. **Lock-free Algorithms**: Reducing contention
6. **Caching**: At multiple layers of the architecture

Understanding this architecture will help you leverage Boson's capabilities effectively and extend the framework to meet your specific needs.
