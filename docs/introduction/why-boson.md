# Why Boson?

In a landscape filled with web frameworks across numerous programming languages, Boson fills a specific niche by combining C++'s performance with modern ergonomics. This page explores the rationale behind choosing Boson for your projects.

## The C++ Advantage

C++ has traditionally been overlooked for web development despite its significant advantages:

- **Superior Performance**: Near-metal execution speed with minimal overhead
- **Resource Efficiency**: Precise memory control and minimal footprint
- **Predictable Behavior**: Deterministic resource management
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Decades of battle-tested libraries and tools

Boson unlocks these advantages for web development by providing abstractions that feel familiar to developers accustomed to high-level frameworks.

## Compared to Other C++ Web Frameworks

While other C++ web frameworks exist, Boson differentiates itself through:

| Feature | Boson | Other C++ Frameworks |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Modern C++ Support | Embraces C++17/20 | Often rely on older C++ standards |
| API Design | Clean, expressive APIs | Typically more verbose approaches |
| Middleware Support | First-class concept | Limited or complex implementations |
| Database Abstraction | Rich query builder and ORM | Basic database connectivity |
| Development Experience | Developer-friendly tooling | More complex workflows |
| Documentation | Comprehensive and accessible | Often sparse or technical |

## Compared to Non-C++ Frameworks

When comparing Boson to popular frameworks in other languages:

### Performance

Boson typically achieves:
- 5-20x higher request throughput than Ruby/Python frameworks
- 2-5x higher throughput than Node.js/Java frameworks
- Significantly lower latency and smaller memory footprint

### Development Trade-offs

| Framework Type | Development Speed | Performance | Resource Usage |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Dynamic Language Frameworks | Very Fast | Low | High |
| JVM-Based Frameworks | Fast | Moderate | Moderate-High |
| Go/Rust Frameworks | Moderate | High | Low |
| **Boson (C++)** | Moderate-Fast | Very High | Very Low |

Boson aims to provide the best balance between development productivity and runtime performance.

## Ideal Use Cases

Boson is the right choice when:

1. **Performance is critical** - High-throughput APIs, real-time services
2. **Resources are constrained** - Edge computing, embedded systems, cost-sensitive deployments
3. **Latency must be minimized** - Trading systems, gaming backends, real-time analytics
4. **C++ is already in use** - Integrating with existing C++ codebases
5. **Predictability is required** - Systems where garbage collection pauses would be problematic

## When to Consider Alternatives

Boson might not be the best fit when:

- The development team has no C++ experience and timeline is very tight
- The project is a simple CRUD application with no performance requirements
- Rapid prototyping is more important than long-term performance

## The Boson Promise

By choosing Boson, you're investing in:

- Performance that scales with your success
- A codebase that can evolve with your needs
- A framework that respects both developers and machines
- A sustainable approach to web development

In the next sections, we'll explore the feature set that makes Boson a powerful choice for modern web development.
