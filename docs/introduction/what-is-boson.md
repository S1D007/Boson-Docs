# What is Boson?

Boson is a modern, high-performance C++ web framework designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It's engineered from the ground up to deliver exceptional performance while providing an elegant and intuitive developer experience.

## Overview

Boson combines the raw power and efficiency of C++ with a clean, modern API inspired by popular web frameworks in other languages. This unique approach allows developers to build high-performance web services without sacrificing developer productivity.

## Key Characteristics

- **Performance-First Design**: Built for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for high-traffic applications and real-time services
- **Modern C++ Approach**: Leverages C++17/20 features to provide an expressive, safe, and efficient programming model
- **Ergonomic API**: Intuitive interfaces that make web development in C++ accessible and productive
- **Modular Architecture**: Flexible, composable components that can be used independently or together
- **Safety & Stability**: Strong emphasis on memory safety and resilience, crucial for mission-critical applications
- **Production Ready**: Designed for real-world usage with comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities

## Where Boson Excels

Boson is particularly well-suited for:

- High-traffic web applications where performance is critical
- Real-time systems requiring minimal latency
- Microservices architectures demanding efficiency
- Applications with strict resource constraints
- Mission-critical services requiring stability and predictability
- Systems integrating with existing C++ codebases

## Philosophy

Boson is built on these core principles:

1. **Performance without compromise**: Optimized for speed without sacrificing developer experience
2. **Simplicity over complexity**: Clean APIs that make common tasks easy and complex tasks possible
3. **Safety by default**: Design choices that promote memory safety and prevent common errors
4. **Flexible but opinionated**: Clear conventions with the flexibility to adapt to various use cases
5. **Comprehensive but modular**: A complete solution where components can be used independently

In the following sections, we'll explore the framework in depth, from getting started to advanced usage patterns.
